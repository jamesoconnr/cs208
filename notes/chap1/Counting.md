### 1.1 Additive and Multiplicative Principles
- additive principle = if event A can occur in m ways and event B can occur in n disjoint wats, the "A or B" can occur in m + n ways
- ^ events need to be disjoint (A and B cannot happen at the same time)
- additive principle works with more than two events
- multiplicative principle = if event A can occur in m ways and each possibility of A allows for n ways of event B, then "A and B" can occur in m Â· n ways
- multiplicative principle also works with more than two events
- in a set with not common elements $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$
- $$A \times B = \{(x, y): x \in A \land y \in B\}$$ is a new set where x = A<sub>n</sub> and y = A<sub>n</sub>
- ^ is a cartestian product
- $$|A \times B|$$ is the union of disjoint sets 
- multiplicative principle = given A and B, $$|A \times B| = |A| * |B|$$
- if |A| = 10 and |B| = 8 and $$|A \cap B| = 6$$ then when we know 4 are in A and not in B
- So $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \hat B|
