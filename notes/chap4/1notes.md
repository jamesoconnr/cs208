- Investigate!

    First set are all the same. Of the second set the first two are the same. Of the 3rd set I dont think they are the same.

- Graphs are made of dots called vertices and connecting lines called edges

- When two vertices are connected by an edge they are adjacent

- A is and ordered pair $G=(V,E)$ consisting of a nonempty set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E), which is a two-element subset of V.

- A graph is the same as another if the vertex and edge sets are equal

- Ex 4.1.1

    No, the edge sets are different

- Graphs that are basically the same but not technically the same (like in ex 4.1.1) are isomorphic.

- Ex 4.1.2

    They are not the same because the actual points are not the same. However, they are isomorphic

- [Def for isomorphism](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_gt-intro.html#:~:text=Isomorphic%20Graphs.,isomorphism%20between%20two)

- Ex 4.1.3

    Intuitively I would say they are neither but I suppose they are isomorphic

- A collection of isomorphic graphs is an isomorphism class. 

- If a graph is an element of another it is a subgraph of the other. A subgraph must share all of its vertices and edges with the larger graph.

- An induced subgraph is a subgraph that has all of the edges of the remaining vertices from the larger graph. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQPbiy4KkBQ) for further explanation

- You cannot fill in the gaps and create a new edge in a subgraph, [see example here](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_gt-intro.html#:~:text=%F0%9F%94%97-,Example%204.1.4.,-Consider%20the%20graphs)

- A graph with more than one edge connecting two vertexes is a multigraph

- Graphs can also be unconnected

- A complete graph is one which contains all possible edges. There is only one per a given graph and it is referred as $K_n$ with n being the number of vertices.

- The # of edges coming from a given vortex is that vortex's degree

- There are $\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$ vertices in $K_n$. Or ${n \choose 2}$

- Example 4.1.6

    The sum is 20, so there are 10 edges. There are 7 terms so there are 7 vertices

- Example 4.1.7

    Well that would be a $7*9=63$ which is odd so its not possible

- A graph is bipartite if it can be divided into two sets and none of the vertices within said sets are adjacent. Vertices can adjacent to vertices in the other set, but not in their own. If each vertex in one graph is adjacent to all vertices in another than it is a complete bipratite graph, or $K_{m,n} where m is the length of one set and n is the length of the other.

- A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex but repeats no other vertices
