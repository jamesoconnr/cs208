1. Differences are $2, 4, 6, etc.$ which have a difference of two. Its a $\triangle^2-constant$ so its a quadratic. Plugging in 0 I find that c is 0. Then plugging in n=1 and n=2 you have to solve the system 
$$ 2=a+b $$
$$ 6 = 4a+2b $$
and find that a = 1 and b = 0, so the the formula is $a_n = n^2 + n $. See notebook p1 for solve.

2. diffs are $1, 2, 4, 7, 11$, diffs of which are $1, 2, 3, 4$, diffs of which $1, 1, 1$. So its $\triangle^3-constant$ meaning its a trinomial. Got stuck trying to solve, see notebook p1.

3. diffs are $3, 6, 10, 15$, diffs of which are $3, 4, 5$, diffs of which are $1, 1, 1$. See notebook p1 for solve, but formula is $a_n=\dfrac{1}{6}n^3+n^2+\dfrac{11}{6}n+2$

4. diffs are $3, 6, 10, 15$ so its the same as exercise 3 but $d=3$. So its $a_n=\dfrac{1}{6}n^3+n^2+\dfrac{11}{6}n+3$

5. . 

    a. We can work backwards here. First diffs could be $3, 6, 9, 12$ and the sequence could be $0, 3, 9, 18, 30$

6. The diffs are $2, 4, 6, 8$ and the second diffs are $2, 2, 2$. Because it is $\triangle^2-constant$ I know it is a quadratic. I can see each number is $n+1$ less than the square of $n$, so the formula is $a_n=n+^2-n+1$

7. Well the diffs are $9, 23, 43, 69, 101$, second diffs are $14, 20, 26, 32$, third diffs are $6, 6, 6$. So we know this is a third degree polynomial. We know a base third degree polynomial sequence would be $2, 12, 36, 80, ...$. So we see each number in the original sequence is this minus $n$. Formula is $n^3+n^2-n+1$

8. Starting at $a_0$ the first few terms are $4, 8, 14, 22, 32, 44, 58$. Diffs are $4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...$ (increasing by two). Formula is $a_n-a_{n-1}=2n+2$

9. Well I suppose that it is just $a_n-a_{n-1} = dn+d$, where d is the constant difference found at $\triangle^2$. I don't understand the answer, TODO.

10. diffs are $3, 4, 7, 11, 18$, seconds diffs are $1, 3, 4, 7$. Im going to stop here because i'm just getting the same numbers so its impossible.

11. diffs are $4, 12, 36, 108$, second diffs are $8, 24, 72$, doesn't look right. Solution says its exponential so its not equal to a polynomial of any degree.
