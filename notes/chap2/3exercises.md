1. Differences are $2, 4, 6, etc.$ which have a difference of two. Its a $\triangle^2-constant$ so its a quadratic. Plugging in 0 I find that c is 0. Then plugging in n=1 and n=2 you have to solve the system 
$$ 2=a+b $$
$$ 6 = 4a+2b $$
and find that a = 1 and b = 0, so the the formula is $a_n = n^2 + n $. See notebook for solve.

2. diffs are $1, 2, 4, 7, 11$, diffs of which are $1, 2, 3, 4$, diffs of which $1, 1, 1$. So its $\triangle^3-constant$ meaning its a trinomial. Got stuck trying to solve, see notebook.

3. diffs are $3, 6, 10, 15$, diffs of which are $3, 4, 5$, diffs of which are $1, 1, 1$. See notebook for solve, but formula is $a_n=\dfrac{1}{6}n^3+n^2+\dfrac{11}{6}n+2$
