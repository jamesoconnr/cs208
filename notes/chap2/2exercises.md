1. .
	
	a. $a_n = a_{n-1} + 5$ with $a_0 = 0$

	b. $a_n = 5 + 4(n -1)$

	c. Yes it's the 504th (add 1 one for 0th term) term because $2013 = 5+4(n-1)$, $2008 = 4(n-1)$, $502 = n-1$, $503 = n$

	d. There are 133 terms because $533 = 5+4(n-1)$, $528 = 4(n-1)$, $132 = n-1$, $133 = n$

	e. Well $5+533=538$ so we can do $538*133$ and divide that by $2$ and get $3577$

	f. $b_n = 1+\dfrac{n(4n+6)}{2}$

2. . 

	a. $32$

	b. $a_n = 8 + 6n$

	c. $a_1 = 8$ and $a_{99} = 602$, so we do $\dfrac{610*100}{2}$ which is $30500$

3. . 

	a. Well the recursive formula (assuming this starts at 0) is $4+7n$ so $249=4+7n$, $245=7n$, $35 = n$, so there are 36 terms

	b. $\dfrac{253*36}{2}=4554$

4. . 

	a. I suppose we have $n+2$ terms because we have to start at $n = -1$ for it to work

	b. $6n -1$

	c. $\dfrac{(1+6n+7)*n+2}{2}$

5. Skipped because I did this type already
