- Second differences sequence is of differences of differences, third is the difference of those
- $\triangle^k$-constant means a sequence of kth differences are constant$

- Example 2.3.1:

    1. $$1, 4, 7, 10, 13$$
        $$3, 3, 3$$
        so this one is $\triangle^2-constant$

- Arithmetic sequences are always $\triangle^1-constant$, every $\triangle^2-constant$ is the sum of arithmetic sequences and their formula is always quadratic.
- Example 2.3.2

    The differences are $4, 7, 10$, the differences of which are clearly 3. So its a quadratic with $\triangle^3-constant$. We know that standard form for a quadratic is $$a_n=an^2+bn+c$$ and we can deduce $a_0=2$. Plugging this in we get $c=2$. Now, plug in 3 and 7 (n=1, n=2) and do more math.
