- Logic = study of consequence
- An answer is really just a logical argument
- Bad argument = conclusion doesn't follow premises, as in the conclusion is not a consequence of the premises
- Argument = set of statements, one of which is a conclusion and the rest of which are premises. An argument is valid when the conclusion must be true whenever all premises are true, otherwise its invalid. It is possible for all premises to be true and the conclusion be false!
