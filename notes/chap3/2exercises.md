1. . 

    a. for all integers a and b, if a and b are odd then a+b is odd

    b. for integers a and b, if a and b are even then a+b is even

    c. for integers a and b it is not the case that if a+b is even a and b are even

    d. Well  if a is 1 and b is 3 a+b is even but a and b are not.

    e. Same as the original statement

    f. let $a = 2k$ and $a = 2j$ for some ints k and j. $a+b=2k+2j=2(k+j)$

    g. True because the negation of false is true.

2. . 

    a. Proof by contradiction. So x is a prime less than 5, ill choose two. $2=6y+3$, $-1=6y$, $-\dfrac{1}{6}=y$ so y is not an integer

    b. Proof by contrapositive.
