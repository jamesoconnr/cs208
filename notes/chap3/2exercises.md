1. . 

    a. for all integers a and b, if a and b are odd then a+b is odd

    b. for integers a and b, if a and b are even then a+b is even

    c. for integers a and b it is not the case that if a+b is even a and b are even

    d. Well  if a is 1 and b is 3 a+b is even but a and b are not.

    e. Same as the original statement

    f. let $a = 2k$ and $a = 2j$ for some ints k and j. $a+b=2k+2j=2(k+j)$

    g. True because the negation of false is true.

2. . 

    a. Proof by contradiction. So x is a prime less than 5, ill choose two. $2=6y+3$, $-1=6y$, $-\dfrac{1}{6}=y$ so y is not an integer

    b. Direct proof. Assume n is an integer that is a multiple of 3. Therefore n can be written as the sum of consecutive integers

    3. Proof by contrapositive. Assume a and b are even. Therefore $a^2+b^2$ is odd if a or b is odd.

3. .

    a. Direct proof. $n=2k$ for some int k. $2k*8=16k$. $16k=2(8k)$ therefore its even

    b. Converse is if 8n is even so is n. This is false because it is not true for all n. For example 7. $8(7)=56$ which is even, but 7 is not.

4. 

    a. Proof by contrapositive. Assume each number only came up 6 times less. $6*6=36$ which is less than 40 meaning the statement is true.

    b. If you roll 10 dice and no 4 are matching then must be three of any given value. But we cannot have 4 different values, so $3*3=9$

5. So $n=2k$ for some int k. $3n=3(2n)$, therefore 3n is even. Now i will prove the contrapositive of the second one. Assume $n=2k+1$. Then $3n=6k+3$ which factors too $3(2k+1)$ meaning its odd.

6. I will take inspiration from the example in the text and prove by contradiction. Assume $\sqrt{3} is rational, meaning it is equal to a simplified fraction $\dfrac{a}{b}$ for some ints a and b. so $3=\dfrac{a^2}{b^2}$, $3b^2=a^2$, meaning a is divisible by 3 so $a^2=9k^2$. Plugging this back in we get $3b^2=9k^2$, which simplifies to $b^2=3k^2$ meaning both a and b are factors of 3, which contradicts the statement that the fraction is simplified.

7. .

    a. I will do a direct proof. So $a=2k$ and $b=3j$ for some ints k and j. $2k*3j=6kj$, meaning $ab$ is a multiple of 6.

    b. Converse is if ab is a multiple of 6 then either a or b is even and either a or b is a multiple of 3. Consider 6 as ab. It is multiple of 6, but if a and b are 1 and 6 the statement is false.

8. I will prove by contrapositive. If n is even so is 5n. So $n=2k$ for some int k. $5n=10k$ so $5n=2(5k)$ therefore 5n is even

9. I will prove by contradiction, meaning both a and b are odd. $a=2k+1, b=2j+1$. $$4k^2+4k+1+4j^2+4j+1=c^2$$ $$2(2k^2+2k+2j^2+2j+1)=c^2$$. So $(2k+1)^2+b^2=2m$ for some int m. TODO
